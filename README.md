# Karima's Portfolio v2

Hey Reader! Welcome to the codebase of my personal portfolio. Built with **Next.js 15** because life is too short for vanilla JS.

## 💡 Customizing for Yourself

Feel free to fork this and make it your own! Here’s your checklist:

1. **Content:** Update `/data/content.ts` with your info.
2. **Visuals:** Swap project images in `/public/projects/`.
3. **Vibe:** Modify colors in `tailwind.config.ts`.
4. **Fonts:** Switch them up in `layout.tsx` if you're feeling spicy.

> **⭐ Pro-tip:** If you use this template, drop a star on the repo! It’s free and guarantees your code will compile on the first try (mostly).
