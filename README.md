# Karima's Portfolio v2

hey Reader! welcome to my portfolio's codebase!

this is my personal portfolio website built with next.js because i'm not a psychopath who uses vanilla js for everything.

**tech stack that hits different:**
- ⚡ Next.js 15
- 🎨 TypeScript
- 💅 Tailwind CSS
- 🎭 Framer Motion
- 🌙 Dark mode

## 🏃‍♀️ run it locally

```bash
# clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/KarimaTouhami/v2.git
cd v2

# install the goods
npm install
# or if you're a yarn stan: yarn install
# or pnpm install (the cool kids choice)
# or bun install (speed demon mode activated)

# fire it up
npm run dev
```

then yeet yourself over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 🎉

## 📁 project structure (organized queen behavior)

```

## 🎨 features that slap

- 🎯 **smooth af animations** - every interaction is *chef's kiss*
- 📱 **responsive design** - looks fire on mobile, tablet, desktop, smart fridge
- 🌙 **dark/light mode** - This website uses localStorage to save your theme preference (i think its smart?)
- ⚡ **blazing fast** - because ain't nobody got time for slow websites
- 🎭 **custom cursor** - adding that extra spice
- 📧 **contact form** - slide into my dms (professionally)

## 🛠️ scripts you'll actually use

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run start
npm run lint
```

## 🎯 deployment (pushing to prod hits different)

deployed on vercel because they literally invented next.js and it just works™️

every push to main automatically deploys. obv.

## 💡 customizing this for yourself

feel free to fork this and make it your own! just:
1. update `/data/content.ts` with your info
2. swap out project images in `/public/projects/`
3. modify colors in `tailwind.config.ts` to match your vibe
4. change fonts if you're feeling spicy
5. deploy and slay

**⭐ important:** if you use this as your portfolio template, drop a star on the repo! it's free and makes me happy 🥺 (so your code will compile first try)
